This is a message directed towards people who intend to make content out of this mod.

It's really quite simple: if you make a video or stream showing any part of my mod, credit me for my years of work.

Whether that means putting something like 'mod by Rimea' in the description or shouting me out directly, don't be the person who makes money off of something I am distributing for free without paying me with a tiny bit of exposure.

If I see any notable people ignoring this clear message I will presume they are doing so knowingly and will take the necessary actions.
