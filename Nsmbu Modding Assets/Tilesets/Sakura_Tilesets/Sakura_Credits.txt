Hey there!
Thanks for downloading Sakura SMBU!

Sakura SMBU is a mod of NSMBU which contains 1 complete new world with overall 8 new levels (all stages of World 1 are included). In level 2-1, you can also find the credits.
The hack was tested on Cemu (V. 1.24.0b) and NOT on Wii U, so we don't know if it'll work on the console.

If the game crashes after pressing 2/A in the Title Screen, delete the Title.szs file in the layout folder and replace it with the original Title.szs file of NSMBU.

You have to replace the Title.szs file in the folder of the NSMBU Update Data with the Title.szs file from here (\Sakura SMBU\content\Common\layout)
if you want to have the logo in the title screen.
