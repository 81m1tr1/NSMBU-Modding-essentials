Thanks for downloading Small Super Mario Universe!

General information:

Small Super Mario Universe is a NSMBU hack developed by Team Universe which contains 3 new worlds with overall 26 new levels. All stages of World 1, World 2 and World 3 are included.
The hack was originally supposed to be a full 9 world NSMBU hack and should've been called Super Mario Universe but had to be cancelled because of several problems in development.
The hack was now mainly compiled by Davetendo & DayownerTV to a 3 world NSMBU hack and is called Small Super Mario Universe because it's a shorten version of Super Mario Universe.
The stages from World 1-1 until World 2-6 are the normal stages like they sould've been in the full hack. After that, you will find various mixed stages with different themes.

Note:

1) We recommend playing this hack on a 1.26 version of Cemu or on V.1.22.3 of Cemu if you install the hack via graphic packs.
2) For level 1-4, it is necessary that Cemu is not lagging in the stage and the sound in Cemu has no delay because otherwise the level will not work like it is intended.
   Also, don't play level 1-4 in multiplayer becuase it WILL NOT WORK CORRECTLY! (In general, the hack is not intended to be played in multiplayer.)
3) There are a few known bugs in some Cemu versions regarding the hack:
   - In level 2-3, some mushrooms in the background could be completely black.
   - In level 2-Tower, the poison in the second half after the Checkpoint could look cursed when it begins to rise. This shouldn't be longer than a few seconds.
